A HUGE Thanks [imaaronjames](https://github.com/imaaronjames) and [jpwain](https://github.com/jpwain) for improving the structure & organization of the file!

###Sketch file updates:

##v1.2 - Improved info and coordinates by [jpwain](https://github.com/jpwain)
* Moved the artboards to start at 0,0 coordinate.
* Added an _About artboard
* Added a version string for the file (because it varies from the Google release number) to the About artboard.
